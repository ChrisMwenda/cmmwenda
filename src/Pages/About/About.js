Executive summary 
Why a fintech strategy. Financial technology (fintech) has emerged as a key mechanism to deliver greater financial inclusion – to enhance the robustness and inclusivity of the financial system as a whole and to drive greater economic growth in markets worldwide. However, if placed in an under-regulated and unsupportive environment, fintech runs the risk of exacerbating existing challenges in areas such as consumer protection, financial integrity, and economic stability. 
The Government of Rwanda has adopted a five-year fintech strategy for Rwanda to support the fintech ecosystem systematically and holistically in the country, to maximise the potential that fintech holds for economic growth and socio-economic transformation and to mitigate its potential risk. This document outlines the rationale for the strategy, it provides the structure responsible for implementing the strategy, it identifies the interventions and activities required to successfully implement the strategy, and it articulates what success would look like for the strategy.
Informing the strategy. Rwanda’s Vision 2050 articulates the long-term strategic direction for transforming Rwanda’s economy and modernising the lives of all Rwandans. The Fintech Strategy for Rwanda (2022–2027) has been developed to realise two complementary policy goals to support the achievement of Vision 2050: 
    1. Position Rwanda as a regional financial centre.
    2. Promote customer-centric financial inclusion and financial sector development to drive economic and social transformation in Rwanda through fintech development. 
The strategy has two key objectives to realise these policy goals: 
    3. Set Rwanda up as a testing ground for fintech.
    4. Establish Rwanda as a launchpad for fintech. 
These objectives are based on the findings from an in-depth evaluation of the experiences and best practices from key fintech hubs such as Kenya, Lithuania, Singapore, and South Africa, as well as an assessment of the current barriers and opportunities for fintech in Rwanda. Based on this research, Figure 1 below displays Rwanda’s key strengths, or competitive advantages, for becoming a testing ground for fintech as well as a launchpad for fintech. 

Figure 1: Rwanda’s comparative advantage in enabling fintech innovation (Strengths)
Understanding the strategy. To ensure that the fintech strategy achieves its objectives, three key areas of intervention are identified as being most likely to be best suited to supporting a thriving ecosystem in the Rwandan context.  shows the three areas strategically selected. These areas are based on the global fintech assessment and on the country-based assessment of fintech in Rwanda discussed above.
Figure 2: The three core areas for interventions
If effectively and efficiently actioned, the activities underpinning each key area should result in a vibrant and growing local fintech ecosystem supported by a sound enabling environment, significantly improved coordination between ecosystem players, and proactive communication and guidance from the financial regulators. Key indicators of success include: 
    • An annual increase in the number of fintechs (local and foreign) entering Rwanda
    • Increase in usage of digital financial services in Rwanda
    • Fintechs expanding their solutions into the region by using Rwanda as a launchpad from which to enter new markets with their existing products or products that were trialled and tested in Rwanda
    • An annual increase in foreign investment in fintech activities in Rwanda 
    • Rising in fintech rankings globally and in Africa
Implementing the strategy. To action the strategy, the strategy puts forth an organisational structure composed of a steering committee, working groups and a secretariat/implementation coordinator. These are presented in Figure 3 below: 
Figure 3: Organisational structure of the fintech strategy
Together these three bodies are responsible for establishing themselves, for actioning the fintech strategy, and for measuring its success. To further support them the fintech implementation roadmap, following this document, provides detailed activities for the implementation of the strategy for each body in the structure.

Artificial intelligence
At its simplest form, artificial intelligence is a field, which combines computer science and robust datasets, to enable problem-solving. It also encompasses sub-fields of machine learning and deep learning, which are frequently mentioned in conjunction with artificial intelligence. These disciplines are comprised of AI algorithms which seek to create expert systems which make predictions or classifications based on input data. (Source: IBM) 
Blockchain
Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash or land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights or branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved. (Source: IBM)
Crowdfunding
Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising monetary contributions from a large number of people. It is often performed via internet-mediated registries that facilitate money collection for the borrower (lending) or issuer (equity). (Source: EBA)
Cryptocurrency
The ECB has classified cryptocurrencies as a subset of virtual currencies. In a report on Virtual Currency Schemes of 2012, it defined such currencies as a form of unregulated digital money, usually issued and controlled by its developers, and used and accepted among the members of a specific virtual community. (Source: ECB)
Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)
Distributed ledgers use independent computers (referred to as nodes) to record, share and synchronise transactions in their respective electronic ledgers (instead of keeping data centralised as in a traditional ledger). Blockchain is one type of a distributed ledger which organises data into blocks, which are chained together in an append-only mode. (Source: World Bank)
Fintech
Technologically enabled innovation in financial services that could result in new business models, applications, processes or products with an associated material effect on financial markets and institutions and the provision of financial services (Source: FSB) 

Fintech hub 
A fintech hub is the focal point for fintech activity within a region or a network. It is the ecosystem that encompasses the entire infrastructure, organisations and people within the hub, as well as how those elements are organised and engage with one another. (Source: Deloitte) 

Internet of Things (IoT)
IoT refers to everyday items such as lamps, windows and fridges thst are connected to the internet in order to enhance their features. For instance, an oven connected to a cell phone and that one can launch from a distance to pre-heat while still being at work. (Source: DLA PIPER)

Interoperability 
Payment system interoperability allows participants ‒ banks and other payment service providers ‒ from different systems or jurisdictions to conduct, clear and settle payments across systems without participating in multiple systems. (Source: BIS)
Machine learning 
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. (Source: IBM)

Open data 
Data or content is open if anyone is free to use, reuse or redistribute it, subject at most to measures that preserve provenance and openness. There are two dimensions to open data: Data must be legally open and data must be technically open. (Source: World Bank) 

Open finance 
Open finance is a framework to allow consumers and enterprises to access and share their financial data with third-party providers who can then use that data to develop innovative products and services with consent. Unlike Open Banking, which is concerned with current accounts/transaction data, open finance’s scope is much wider, affecting home loan providers, consumer credit providers, investment and pension funds, as well as general insurers and intermediaries. (Source: FSCA)


Regulatory sandbox
Regulatory “sandboxes” provide financial institutions and non-financial firms with a controlled space in which they can test innovative fintech solutions with the support of an authority for a limited period, allowing them to validate and test their business model in a safe environment. (Source: EBA)
Smart contracts
Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary’s involvement or time loss. They can also automate a workflow, triggering the next action when conditions are met. (Source: IBM)

Introduction
The vision for the fintech strategy for Rwanda is to enable a thriving fintech ecosystem. In 2022, Rwanda will set out to implement its first fintech strategy for which the implementation phase is 2022 to 2027. This strategy is geared towards realising two complementary policy goals:
    • Position Rwanda as a regional financial centre. Rwanda’s Vision 2050 and the National Strategy for Transformation 2017–2024 set the aspiration for Rwanda to become a hub for financial services in Africa. To this end, the Kigali International Financial Centre has been established to transform the investment landscape across Africa and to attract capital and funds. The development of the Rwandan fintech landscape and the establishment of Rwanda as a fintech hub will attract investment and provide the technology and financial services needed to make Rwanda a global financial centre. 
    • Promote customer-centric financial inclusion and financial sector development to drive economic and social transformation. The growth of the Rwandan fintech sector links directly to the Rwanda National Payment System (RNPS) Strategy’s 2018–2024 commitment to encourage the use of electronic payments by all residents of Rwanda. Digital payments are widely regarded as a gateway to financial inclusion. Therefore, fintech contributes to building a cashless society. Fintech also enhances the reach and efficiency of financial services more broadly to boost financial inclusion beyond payments. Moreover, fintech can help to make financial inclusion more customer-centric by leveraging technology and data to better meet financial needs. Enhanced usage of digital financial services is also likely to create an onramp for the adoption of more advanced financial products such as insurance and credit – a key goal of the Rwanda Capital Market Master Plan (2018–2028). Such financial inclusion supports socioeconomic development, poverty alleviation and growth by enabling greater productivity and resilience of both enterprises and individuals. It also spurs economic transformation by enhancing value chain efficiency and facilitating cross-border economic activity.
To realise its vision and to achieve the two policy objectives outlined above, the fintech strategy has the following two key objectives: 
    • To set Rwanda up as a testing ground for fintech, by becoming an environment in which local and global fintechs can test complex ideas 
    • To establish Rwanda as a launchpad for fintech, by enabling local and global fintechs to take their tried and tested ideas and expand into Rwanda’s market and markets in the region
Select global developments in fintech: benchmarking
The key objectives above were developed and contextualised for Rwanda based on in-depth research of global fintech hub experience and best practice. Several key global fintech hubs were assessed to inform Rwanda’s fintech strategy. Of these, five were selected for in-depth evaluation based on their global ranking, contextual relevance and similarities to Rwanda. These are Singapore, Lithuania, Kenya, South Africa and Chile.  shows a summary of the key contributors to the success of each of these fintech hubs, for more detail on the benchmarking exercise, kindly see Table 12 in the annex. 
Figure 4: Summary of the contributing factors to fintech hub success
From the in-depth evaluation, the following key cross-cutting lessons were extracted: 
    • Clear and progressive regulation and regulatory guidance are essential for fintech development. All fintech hubs evaluated ensure that the fintech sector is well guided by foundational regulations, such as anti-money laundering Acts, consumer protection laws and so forth, and fintech-specific regulations and guidance papers, such as the “soft law guidance” developed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on topics including digital token offerings, robo-advisors, and e-payments. Regulation is a key factor that contributes to the success of a fintech hub, both in terms of attracting business (landing big deals by creating a business-friendly environment) and in terms of standing out as a regional leader (balancing the need for protecting with innovation provisions). 
    • Majority of fintech hubs prioritise the paytech sub-sector. Paytech is the most popularly prioritised fintech sub-sector across all four selected fintech hubs. This focus is mirrored in Rwanda, where most fintechs are active in the paytech sector as well. 
Of the fintech hubs assessed, Singapore and Lithuania share significant geographic, strategic and contextual parallels with Rwanda. Based on these parallels, both were drawn on to shape the two key objectives of the Rwandan fintech strategy. A brief case study of each is provided below: 
    • Singapore leveraged its geographic location and its progressive regulatory backing, talent pool and business support to become a world-renowned fintech hub for investors and entrepreneurs. Despite having a relatively small internal market compared to its neighbours, Singapore used its strengths to attract fintechs from around the world to set up and test their ideas in Singapore. Key to its success has been the fact that it has eased the movement of fintechs across borders, thus giving fintechs in Singapore access to cross-border customers and partners throughout Southeast Asia1. In effect, Singapore became the fintech gateway to Southeast Asia. Like Singapore, Rwanda has a relatively small internal market that will struggle to attract global fintechs based solely on local demand. However, Rwanda also has a strong reputation for its political stability and transparency and for having a progressive regulatory approach to fintech. This competitive advantage, coupled with its strategically favourable geographic location, makes it possible to duplicate elements of Singapore’s success. 
    • Lithuania, in contrast to Singapore, leveraged a key socio-political event to catapult itself into the list of top fintech hubs. Key to its success was leveraging Brexit – as the UK lost appeal as the gateway to the EU market. Like Singapore. Lithuania did not compete with other global fintech hubs based on traditional criteria of dominance such as size or quantity of fintechs. Instead, Lithuania took advantage of a gap in the market left by the UK and offered fintechs across the EU a supportive and transparent fintech ecosystem supported by key mechanisms such as quick, easy and even remote licensing, and administrative and logistical support. Easy licensing was also supported by a strong payment system and supporting infrastructure. This led to Lithuania positioning itself as an attractive entry point for fintechs entering or wanting to expand across the European market. 
The two case studies depicted above offer two unique perspectives and growth paths that countries have taken to become leading fintech hubs. Many relevant insights can be drawn from their experience. Most significantly for Rwanda, both countries have chosen to leverage their fintech ecosystems to: 
    1. Encourage local innovation and fintech development by leveraging core elements of the fintech ecosystem such as strong regulatory support for fintech and business support to make it easy for fintechs to set up and operate, and 
    2. Serve as a launchpad for fintech into the region by attracting global fintechs by offering an attractive platform (fintech ecosystem) to expand into their respective regions. 
Based on these key insights, the fintech strategy mirrors them in its own two key objectives to enable economic development and to support ambitions to becoming a global financial centre. 
The next section gives a description of a thriving fintech ecosystem and what success would look like for the fintech strategy.

Overview of Rwanda’s current fintech ecosystem
Rwandan fintech sector remaining relatively small but growing. Analysis conducted in support of this fintech strategy identified a total of 75 fintechs that are currently operating in Rwanda. Although still relatively small, this represents significant recent growth from 17 in 2014 to 44 in 20192, equating to 70% growth in the number of fintechs operating in the country in just the last two to three years, even despite the economic impacts of Covid-19.
Fintech subsectors. The majority of fintechs identified include payments, clearing and settlement providers along with fintech enablers3 (both subsectors are made up of 22 fintechs). This is followed by deposit lending (16), insurance (5), savings (5), capital raising/alternative finance (4) and crypto assets (1) (Figure 5). Moreover, in terms of the service offering of fintechs, 56% are catered towards B2C services (business-to-consumer), followed by B2B (36%), G2C (4%), B2G (3%) and C2C (1%)4. The low penetration of fintechs offering more advanced financial services, such as insurance and capital raising products, suggests there may be an opportunity for fintechs’ pilot products in the space, while it may also be symptomatic of a lack of demand for such products. 
Economic sector. In addition to the fintech subsector, the economic sector within which the fintech is based was also noted. Unsurprisingly, 47 of the fintechs operate purely in the financial sector, followed by transport (7), agriculture (7), energy (6), education (2) and health (1). (Five of the fintechs identified are sector agnostic). The low number of fintechs that offer services tailored for the agricultural sector, which employs nearly 72% of all Rwandans and makes up a third of all economic activity5, highlights an important opportunity for fintechs, which also has the potential to expand customer-centric financial inclusion. 
Figure 5: Fintech category and sub-sectoral breakdown of Rwandan fintechs
Homegrown fintechs. In terms of the proportion of fintechs that are homegrown, 52% of all fintechs identified were founded in Rwanda, while 12% and 7% were founded in the US and Kenya respectively. The remaining 39% are dispersed across 10 different countries6. The high proportion of fintechs which have set up in Rwanda with foreign origins suggests Rwanda is an attractive proposition for foreign fintechs to expand into and pilot financial products.
Rwanda and Kigali relatively highly ranked within Africa as fintech hubs, but with significant room for growth. The Findexable Global Fintech Index ranks both countries and cities on the basis of three categories:
    1. The quantity of privately owned fintech companies
    2. The quality of those countries
    3. The local business enabling environment
Rwanda entered the index for the first time in 2021 and was ranked 61st globally and fifth in Africa. Kigali was ranked as the 166th most desirable city for fintech globally and was eighth in Africa. 

Rwanda’s fintech ecosystem imperatives 

A thriving fintech ecosystem is characterised by an enabling environment that spans six core ecosystem enablers7:
    1. The underlying infrastructure is in place to provide fintechs with the rails to build customer-centric solutions. This includes interoperability to enhance payment system efficiency and consistent mobile network quality. 
    2. The policy, legal and regulatory environment supports fintech solutions while balancing financial stability, financial consumer protection, data governance, financial inclusion and competition. This is done through risk-based requirements and a test-and-learn approach to regulating fintech activities.
    3. Fintechs have access to relevant and appropriate business support, including transparent and timely licensing processes, soft guidance on how to navigate the licensing and compliance process and the facilitation of collaboration between fintechs and incumbent financial sector players though initiatives such as fintech Fridays to build the fintech community.
    4. Fintechs have diverse avenues to access finance throughout the development lifecycle of the firm – from early-stage seed capital to strategic capital for more established fintechs.
    5. To this is added market access, facilitated through a digitally and financially literate population who is aware of their rights and who has access to affordable smartphones, other fintech-friendly technology and devices, and adequately priced digital connectivity. Access to this consumer base need to be supported by quality internet coverage, which is widely accessible at a reasonable price.
    6. Finally, a thriving fintech ecosystem is characterised by a strong talent pipeline, developed through a national talent plan, international partnerships to upskill the workforce, and an easily accessible work visa regime. These mechanisms used to develop the talent pipeline should go beyond the traditional focus on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) skills. They should also focus on skills specifically required by the fintech industry to grow, such as financial skills (having an analytical ability and an awareness of the financial industry) and entrepreneurial skills (invoking a will to start building ones own business and the skills to make this business a success, such as business management skills, strategic thinking and planning, and problem-solving skills). 
Overview of the strengths and weaknesses of Rwanda’s fintech ecosystem. Rwanda’s fintech ecosystem is characterised by key strengths that are also its competitive advantages for fintech development in the next five years. Thus far, these have contributed to Rwanda earning its title as one of Africa’s fastest-growing fintech ecosystems8.  However, it also has several roadblocks that could potentially stifle fintech innovation and block the fintech strategy’s vision. Table 1 below provides an overview of the state of Rwanda’s fintech environment, depicting the strengths and weaknesses of each ecosystem enabler in the Rwandan context: 
#
Ecosystem enabler
Status
Key strengths and weaknesses

1
Underlying infrastructure 

Strengths. A population ready for DFS adoption – youthful, geographically concentrated, strong mobile penetration (87%), fast-growing mobile payments, well-developed digital ID system.
Weaknesses. Firstly, costly data localisation requirements result in fintechs having to set up physical servers and data infrastructure. Secondly, lack of full-scale interoperability of retail payments. Finally, internet penetration in Rwanda remains low (31.4% in January 2021)9.

2
Regulatory environment

Strengths. Strong leadership with regulators and policymakers known to be open to innovation. 
Weaknesses. Firstly, the regulatory environment is characterised by limited proactive engagement with the fintech ecosystem and a lack of non-legally binding (soft law) guidance to the market. Secondly, there is a lack of a clear entry point/ point of departure for fintechs in entering Rwanda or navigating regulation and the environment. Lastly, amidst new and emerging technologies, a lack of appropriate financial consumer protection risks eroding consumers’ trust in financial markets

3
Market access

Strengths. Strategically located market, providing a bridge between the vibrant and lucrative Central and East African markets (with a combined population of 345 million).
Weaknesses: Limited domestic market. In comparison to neighbouring economies – like Kenya, Rwanda possesses a small population of 12.4 million and relatively lower GDP per capita. Achieving scale through regional expansion is curtailed by the absence of licensing portability agreements, which means that Rwandan-based fintechs looking to expand beyond Rwanda’s borders will have to apply and meet the regulatory requirements for a new licence in every jurisdiction, adding regulatory compliance burdens.

4
Access to talent

Strengths. Strong pool of tech talent. Through its 14 academic institutions and world-class training centres, Rwanda produces graduates with specialised skillsets required in the development of fintechs.
Weaknesses. Demand for fintech talent outstrips supply – while Rwandan academic institutions are producing well-qualified STEM graduates, there aren’t enough to keep up with demand. While difficulties hiring non-Rwandans and the absence of a fintech-specific work visa, means that this mismatch is unable to be filled by foreign fintech talent.

5
Access to finance

Strengths. The Rwanda Innovation Fund (RIF), the KIFC Africa Fintech Fund, the National Innovation Fund, and the Business Development Fund offered in Rwanda provide a direct mechanism to address the financing gap that tech-enabled companies face at different growth stages in Rwanda and across the continent. Furthermore, innovation in digital-capital-raising solutions are being pursued as part of the Rwanda Capital Market Master Plan 2018–2028.
Weaknesses. The financing gap is cited as the most significant business constraint faced by Rwandan enterprises (31% vs 24% in SSA). Early-stage fintechs struggle to access traditional debt financing, while the venture capital (VC) and private equity investment ecosystem is still nascent. This is the case for two key reasons: firstly because there is a lack of grant and early-stage funding, and secondly because there is limited traditional debt financing mechanisms from the incumbent financial sector catered for start-ups and MSMEs. Collectively, these two mean that many Rwandan fintechs are over-reliant on informal financing mechanisms (such as friends and families). 

6
Business support

Strengths. The safety and stability of Rwanda, as compared to other countries in the region, offer a unique pulling point for fintechs and professionals. There is also a strong presence of a number of cross-sectoral accelerators, hubs and incubators in Rwanda that provide workspace, mentorship, connections and linkages to investors – including Rwanda FinTecHub, which offers these business support services catered to fintechs.
Weaknesses. Ad hoc collaboration within the fintech ecosystem and fragmented support are significant weaknesses within the Rwandan fintech ecosystem. To date, a limited number of partnerships have been developed between fintechs, the incumbent financial sector and MNOs. In addition, the concept of data sharing is not yet embraced across the private sector and the public sector. Finally, there is insufficient capacity in the public sector and the private sector to appropriately identify and manage risks and market development.

Status of key fintech-enabling frameworks
Various regulatory initiatives are currently in place or are being developed which support the broader fintech innovation ecosystem in Rwanda. These include:
    1. Data Protection and Privacy Law: In October 2021, a new law that governs protection of personal data and privacy was officially gazetted. The primary objective was to provide clear and unambiguous consent of an individual to the collection, storage, and processing of personal data, which is a fundamental right in Rwanda. The law now brings Rwanda in line with international data protection standards, which is vital for the modern digital economy as it facilitates services such as e-commerce, international financial transactions, and various online services.
    2. Open Banking: While no formal regulatory initiatives have been implemented with respect to Open Banking in Rwanda, BNR, MINECOFIN and MINICT are exploring the potential benefits that the introduction of such initiatives might have for the broader financial sector. The updated Data Protection and Privacy Law lays the foundation for its implementation, providing consumers with the ability to determine whether their data can be utilised by third parties.
    3. Digital ID: 95% of the population is covered by the national population registry with an online identity verification. Rwanda issues a digital ID card with a 2D barcode to every citizen in addition to an optional e-ID. The Irembo platform allows various public services and documents to be requested and issued to citizens using their identification through a unique national identity number printed on the ID card. Other private entities, such as banks and MNOs, have also been granted access to the national population registry database to facilitate the implementation of their KYC policies10.
    4. Regulatory sandboxes: Further innovative regulatory practices that Rwandan regulators are using to catalyse fintech innovation include the introduction of regulatory sandboxes – with BNR, RURA and CMA11 all providing access to a sandbox related to innovations that fall under their regulatory purview. Both BNR and RURA are considering new regulatory sandbox regulations (at the time of writing). The BNR launched its regulatory sandbox in 2018, but it perceived that onerous compliance requirements led to very few applications, with the implication that BNR is in the process of amending its sandbox regulations with the aim of releasing an updated version during 2022. The relative proliferation of sandboxes and references to sandboxes, such as in the Insurance Act of 2021, does create a more complicated regulatory environment for fintechs to navigate, meaning clear supporting guidance to the market and clear coordination between regulators will be imperative as these sandboxes are finalised and launched.
Table 2, below, illustrates the medium-to-long-term opportunities that can be leveraged in Rwanda to achieve the two key objectives and the threats/risks to the fintech strategy’s vision.
Opportunities
Threats
Policy support creates a space to test and demonstrate more intricate proofs of concept that could set Rwanda apart. Significant international investment appetite in fintech on the continent
There remains a continued risk that the incumbent sector largely sees fintech as competition rather than partners.
Forward-thinking regulators and regulations act as a signal to the market that Rwanda is proactively shaping and enabling the fintech space. This is evident by key mechanisms such as RURA and the BNR’s sandboxes, as well as the forthcoming Fintech Regulatory Sandbox Guidelines (CMA, 2022).
Relative attractiveness of Kenya
One of the first to ratify Africa Free Trade Agreement, adding an important use case for fintechs in cross-border trade opportunities
Too many competing projects/goals in the country leading to delays in guidance, regulation and infrastructure
Given the lack of regulation and understanding of emerging technologies among regulators on the continent, there is an opportunity for Rwanda to act as a first mover.
Fintechs enter Rwanda to test the concept but then leave.
Leveraging its strong leadership role in the region, Rwanda is positioned to facilitate partnership linkages regionally and internationally.

Table 2: Opportunities and threats to Rwanda’s fintech ecosystem over the medium-to-long term
Focusing the strategy
Identifying the interventions with the greatest marginal benefit to the Rwandan fintech ecosystem. Section 5, above, provides a detailed SWOT analysis of Rwanda’s existing fintech-enabling environment. As highlighted by the weaknesses identified across all six categories of the enabling environment, a plethora of potential actions and interventions can be taken to support fintech development in Rwanda. 
The objective of this strategy is to identify which interventions are both feasible and will have the greatest positive impact on supporting the growth of fintech within Rwanda, given scarce resources.
Three key areas of intervention are identified as likely to be most impactful in supporting a thriving ecosystem in the Rwandan context:
    1. The various Rwandan regulatory authorities need to play a proactive role in orchestrating a local ecosystem by providing proactive regulatory guidance in order to provide regulatory clarity and to support a vibrant testing ground that draws innovators in. Research (both within Rwanda and globally) in support of this strategy, found that regulation is generally not a primary barrier to fintech development in Rwanda. However, proactive guidance and engagement by the regulator were largely lacking; and, as demonstrated in other global fintech hubs, these are crucial in ensuring regulatory certainty for innovators and investors and signalling interest and capability of local regulators to effectively engage and enable new innovations. This strategy aims to address this challenge with an emphasis on expanding the range of communication tools and non-legally binding regulatory instruments developed by the regulatory authorities. These range from formally published guidance frameworks through to Q&As or FAQs. 
    2. Coordination is a critical prerequisite to an effective fintech-enabling environment. Rwanda has a wide range of institutions supporting fintech; however, these often operate independently and with limited or insufficient coordination between them. The implication for fintechs in Rwanda is a confusing and complex web of regulators, government departments, parastatal companies, private institutions, and development organisations to navigate. Addressing these coordination challenges sits at the very centre of proposed governance structures for the fintech strategy. By including key public and private sector institutions as part of the committee responsible for implementing the strategy, requires these institutions to engage more regularly and deliberately around fintech-related topics and to work together. The strategy also emphasises the need for clear access points and guidance to fintechs in how to navigate the local ecosystem, such as developing and maintaining a single, central Rwanda fintech website.
    3. At the same time, regional leadership and proactive regional engagement are required to attract fintech entrants and to facilitate a path for expansion for fintechs that extend beyond the scale of the domestic Rwandan market. The strategy focuses on activities to engage with regional regulators to ease fintech expansion beyond Rwanda and engagement with regional and global fintechs to encourage them to operate and test new products within the enabling Rwandan ecosystem. Specific actions to support this objective include:
    • Positioning Rwanda as a “centre of excellence”, with a deep understanding of fintech among regulators and policymakers
    • Exploring licensing portability in East Africa and building strong relationships with regulators in other jurisdictions to ease the entry of Rwandan-licensed fintechs
    • Providing support, guidance and advice to fintechs to enter new regional markets
    • Establishing country hub partnerships with global fintech hubs such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Lithuania and the UK, and within Africa with South Africa and Kenya, to facilitate knowledge exchange, technical assistance and investor matchmaking
    • Leveraging foreign missions to advocate for Rwandan-based fintech and to support Rwandan fintechs to scale into those jurisdictions
    • Taking centre stage in regional and global fintech forums
    • Hosting competitions and festivals to generate and sustain fintech interest in Rwanda
What does success look like?
What does success for the fintech strategy look like? Success for the fintech strategy would mean a vibrant and growing local fintech ecosystem supported by a sound enabling environment. Success for the fintech strategy would be a significantly improved coordination between ecosystem players, such that new local fintechs and new foreign entrants are clear on the requirements for them to operate and can navigate the local business support, funding, and regulatory environment with relative ease. Furthermore, regular proactive communication and guidance from the financial regulators, supported by the fintech strategy structures, would have provided clarity to fintechs on emerging innovation topics, giving them greater confidence to adopt and adapt to these new innovations and more easily secure finance. 
Success breeds success; and so an enhanced enabling environment with ease of access to support and greater clarity, supported by proactive measures to encourage new fintech entrants, should contribute towards a growing network and ecosystem within Kigali and translate into growing numbers of fintechs operating locally and increasingly accessing foreign investment. Indicators of this success includes the following: 
    • A 50% annual increase in the number of fintechs (local and foreign) entering Rwanda to operate in Rwanda and/or to test complex product ideas. This would indicate that the improvements made to Rwanda’s fintech ecosystem has simplified the process through which fintechs set up and operate in Rwanda and that these improvements have made Rwanda more attractive to fintechs, especially for testing innovative digital solutions. This contributes to the policy goal of making Rwanda a world-class innovation hub. 
    • An increased and deepened fintech talent pool in Rwanda will substantially improve the quality of the fintech ecosystem by creating a local knowledge base from which local and foreign fintechs can draw to set up, test and expand their ideas, services, and products. This indicator of success will depend on activities promoted by the Fintech Strategy for Rwanda such as an integrated learning policy for financial sector players, upskilling sessions for regulators, and fintech challenges and conferences. It will also depend on the development of incentives to attract foreign talent, the removal of barriers for foreign talent to enter Rwanda, and on the establishment of agreements with other fintech hubs to enable mentorship and linkages between Rwandan talent and other markets. 
    • Increase in local demand for digital solutions. Promoting Rwanda as a testing ground for fintech will attract fintechs who want to provide digital solutions specifically for the African context (such as attempting to reach the large portion of unbanked and underbanked populations). Attracting these fintechs would offer Rwandans first access to financial products that meet their needs, thus also stimulating local demand and usage. This would contribute to the policy goal of driving economic and social transformation through customer-centric financial sector development. 
    • Fintechs expanding their solutions into the region by using Rwanda as a launchpad from which to enter new markets with their existing products or with products that were trialled and tested in Rwanda. Subsequently, building the narrative that Rwanda is the gateway for entering the African fintech market, thus also contributing to the policy goal of making Rwanda a world-class innovation hub.
    • A 50% annual increase in foreign investment. Investment in fintech has grown rapidly, specifically in countries with more capacity for innovation and better regulations12. This fintech strategy provides a roadmap for improving Rwanda’s capacity for innovation and clarity around regulations, among other key development areas, thereby inspiring investor confidence and promoting the image of Rwanda as an innovation hub. The fintech strategy for Rwanda will thus contribute to an increase in foreign investment, specifically in fintech. Foreign investment can also be used as a rough proxy for how the local fintech ecosystem is perceived globally.
    • Improve global ranking into the top 30 globally and best in Africa. By 2027 and by the conclusion of the fintech strategy, success would be a significant improvement in the global ranking of Rwanda as a fintech hub. Using Findexable’s Global Fintech rankings as a benchmark, Rwanda should aim to rise from its current position in 61st globally and 5th on the continent to the top 30 globally and 1st in Africa.

The implementation 
The Rwanda fintech ecosystem comprises an intricate landscape of government ministries, regulators, initiatives, ecosystem facilitators, innovation accelerators/incubators and funding bodies. This multiplicity creates a strong and diverse environment for fintech innovation, which is central to the implementation of the strategy.  provides an overarching structure for all the active supporting actors in the system. 
Figure 6: Overarching structure of the active supporting actors in the system
The strategy will be implemented via a two-tier, interdepartmental system:
    • Steering committee as core governance structure. The first tier is a steering committee formed by the National Bank of Rwanda (BNR), the Ministry of ICT and Innovation (MINICT), the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN), the Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority (RURA) and the Capital Markets Authority (CMA), together with Rwanda Finance Limited (RFL), the Rwanda Bankers Association (RBA), the Rwanda Insurance Association (ASSAR), the Association of Microfinance Institutions (AMIR), the ICT Chamber and the fintech association. Additional representatives from the private sector can be considered, and the formation of associations can be requested. Co-chaired by the MINICT and MINECOFIN, these 11 institutions form the central governance structure for the fintech strategy in Rwanda and take ultimate accountability for its outcomes. 
The steering committee works towards the vision of creating an enabling environment for fintechs that will establish Rwanda as an innovation hub and promote financial sector development in line with the three core principles of orchestration, foundational frameworks, and regional leadership. It provides overarching direction for the fintech strategy and, as relevant, leads cross-cutting initiatives. As such, the steering committee is responsible for overseeing the working groups that form the second tier and for leveraging the inputs from other parties, such as the Rwanda Development Board, Kigali Innovation City, Kigali International Financial Centre, FinTecHub, Fablab, K-LAB, 250 Start Up, Africa50, among others, as relevant.
    • Working groups as implementation arm. The second tier comprises a series of interdepartmental working groups formed under the auspices of the steering committee. They are the implementation arm of the strategy, each with an explicit mandate around specific fintech sub-sectors, and accountable to the steering committee for meeting the objectives of the fintech strategy. The split into working groups allows for the strategic utilisation of resources among the key public institutions and for building robust and technical knowledge across a range of fintech activities. The strengths of the various working group individuals can be leveraged in line with their institution’s mandate, and the group setting allows for coordinated discussion and actions to advance specific fintech sub-sector agendas. The objective of coordination is particularly important given that actors within the fintech sector frequently operate outside or across traditionally regulated financial market silos. 
Working group purpose
Inter-governmental coordination to promote Rwanda as a fintech testing ground within each focus sector.
Working group responsibilities
    1. Develop a roadmap and realistic key performance indicators for the implementation of the strategy in each focus sector, in line with the RNPS.
    2. Build expertise on fintech and establish credibility with the market via the release of guidance and position papers and the information exchange with counterparts in other jurisdictions. As new regulation is released, this regulation is interpreted for the sector in question.
    3. Advise on the key risks from within each sub-sector, as well as global regulatory good practice.
    4. Identify potential fintech entrants and link with the relevant domestic or foreign supporting entities.
    5. Assign a relevant working group member or entity to ensure that ecosystem facilitators are present, available and equipped to accompany fintechs through the regulatory, licensing and compliance journey. Work with the relevant institutions along the way to ensure that the process is clear, smooth, quick and proactively communicated with fintechs.

Priority target sectors. The working groups are structured around priority focus sub-sectors. The working groups act as the primary implementation arm of the fintech strategy and are responsible for most of the specified interventions, as outlined in the implementation plan. The priority targets selected are paytech, financing, wealthtech and insurtech, and regtech and suptech. These were strategically selected as the first four fintech subsectors due to their a) prevalence in the global economy and the priorities of other fintech hub emerging economies; b) potential to drive local economic and social transformation; and c) to facilitate the development of Rwanda’s goal to be a world-class innovation hub.
Working groups as critical platforms to enable effective coordination. Further, the working groups are important platforms to enable effective coordination between the different actors that support the fintech ecosystem. Over and above the specific activities proposed for the working groups, the regular engagement between working group members is critical to facilitating improved, proactive coordination and hence clarity for fintechs. Existing financial regulation, and associated regulators, are necessarily siloed by the nature of financial activity. Fintech groups created in line with regulatory silos (such as lending tech and alternative finance), which have correspondingly different regulatory leads (i.e. BNR and CMA respectively), will require a deliberate focus on coordination. Some emerging fintechs are likely to fall within the grey space between categories, which makes it unclear under which regulator authority they most directly fall. A lack of clarity between regulatory authorities in terms of which regulator the fintech should fall under translates into a lack of clarity and certainty for those fintechs. Therefore, over and above the specific activities in process, working group meetings should include discussion on fintechs that fall within these grey areas to enable clarity on which the regulator should lead. 
The paytech working group
Paytech is currently the most popular fintech sub-category among fintech developers, consumers/users of fintech, and investors13. In Africa alone, the volume of cashless transactions is predicted to more than double by 2030, reaching approximately 172 billion cashless transactions14. This growth will undoubtedly impact the paytech space in Rwanda. Currently, fintechs in the payment, clearing and settlement category make up the largest portion of fintechs that operate in Rwanda, comprising a total of 29% of the 75 fintechs operating in the market15. 
According to Statista, the number of users of digital payments in Rwanda is expected to amount to 4.95m by 2025, and the total transaction value is projected to reach RWF25,332 billion. By creating an enabling environment for paytech to thrive, the working group has the potential to ensure that the National Strategy for Transformation’s goal of increasing electronic payment transactions from 27% to 80% of the GDP by 2024 is not only met, but in fact exceeded. Against the backdrop of agriculture being at the core of the Rwandan economy, digital payments also have the potential to reduce transactional costs and make agricultural value chains more efficient, safe and transparent. As the underlying rails for other financial services, paytech has the potential to promote customer-centric financial inclusion and to drive economic and social transformation.
Essential to creating this enabling environment is a workstream dedicated to the use of technology in payments and transactions. This workstream will be responsible for enabling, guiding and monitoring the impact on consumers of fintechs that offer mobile and digital payment solutions. This will cover a wide range of topics pertaining to payments, from crypto assets16 to e-wallet transfers and the implications of innovations such as central bank digital currencies on the Rwandan paytech sector. The workstream will also consider the implications of key regulatory frameworks such as interoperability, consumer protection and cybersecurity for paytech, as well as the scope for fintech innovation in contactless payments, effective transaction pricing, provider competition, data sharing (Open Banking/Open Finance) and IP policies in the context of paytech. Lastly, this working group shares the responsibility, that falls across all working groups, to research and evaluate the need for policy development in relevant and impacting areas such as cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technologies. 
The financing working group
This working group encompasses credit, lending, capital raising and cloud financing, or alternative finance, and refers to financial services and products that have been developed using innovative and predominately online channels, instruments and systems. This working group will focus on key areas such as providing regulatory clarity for financing fintechs in Rwanda, attracting such fintechs to Rwanda and upskilling the market on financing innovations. It will also focus on creating a comprehensive access to finance environment, supported by mechanisms geared towards ensuring that fintechs are finance ready, that they have access to the correct types of finance and that this finance matches their development phase and related needs to secure the productive use of the finances they gain access to. Lastly, this working group will investigate key topics such as P2P/marketplace lending, balance sheet lending, crowdfunding, invoice trading, and securities. 
Lendingtech (credit). The global lendingtech market is forecast to grow at a rate over 24% during the 2019 to 2025 period17. Rwanda is well positioned to take advantage of this growth, because lending tech is currently the second-most active fintech sub-sector, with 21% of the fintech in the Rwandan market being in deposit and lending. However, a barrier in the Rwandan market is that the products currently available to the population are not well suited to their needs. This incentivises people to utilise informal financial services, which often do not offer protection or added benefits such as access to broader financial services like loans. 
Fintechs have the potential to drastically change how lending works for consumers and micro, small and medium-sized businesses by automating and evolving how these target groups engage with, qualify for, and access lines of credit. The working group can enable lendingtech to bridge the gap and offer consumer-centric products, thereby enabling social and economic transformation and economic development. Thus, it contributes to the goals of providing consumer-centric solutions that boost economic growth.
Relevant topics for the working group include alternative lending and credit (such as crowdfunding and P2P lending or buy-now-pay-later schemes), machine learning and algorithmic assessment of creditworthiness, data sharing/Open Data and API standards, and a test-and-learn licensing approach to lending tech. Consumer protection principles to avoid over-indebtedness and safeguard from predatory lending practices, as well as cybersecurity, are also central to this working group. 
Alternative finance. Globally, activities in alternative finance have experienced significant growth, particularly in regions such as the US, Canada and the UK. In 2020, the largest regional alternative market was the US and Canada ($73.93 billion), which accounted for 65% of global online alternative finance market volume18. Sub-Saharan Africa has also experienced growth in alternative finance activities, although its market share remains comparatively small at 1% (USD1.22 billion). Of this growth in sub-Saharan Africa, East Africa leads in the use of alternative finance19, thus putting Rwanda in a good position to tap into its potential. 
Fintechs in alternative finance have several advantages over financial services and products offered by traditional financial institutions. For example, they have the advantage of offering funds with a quick turnaround time, flexibility in terms of what funds can be used for, access to a wide range of funders, and simplified and ease of access by providing their services on digital platforms. Ultimately, these advantages place alternative finance in an ideal position to better service households, consumers and MSMEs that fall outside of traditional banking – subsequently making it a key mechanism to advance national development goals related to financial inclusion, digitisation and economic transformation achieved through a consumer-centric approach. In addition to advancing these goals, alternative finance also presents opportunities to the development of alternative financing instruments for fintechs themselves through, for example, crowdfunding and lending platforms. 
While there are clear advantages to alternative finance, it introduces new risks to the financial system, to customers and businesses, and to the fintechs themselves. In terms of the financial system, the World Bank Group has highlighted the three most prevalent challenges for regulators as being fraud, capital losses and money laundering20. For customers and businesses on the other hand, risks include over-indebtedness. Lastly, the risks for the fintechs include customer fraud, unsustainable increases in defaults, and cyber-security breaches. In response to these, it will be critical for this working group to investigate the risks and to take a clear position on these in order to delineate the scope of operation for fintechs, to prepare its potential customer base and to put effective safeguards in place to mitigate any threats to the robustness of the financial system. 
Given the broad interpretation of financing for this working group, it will be key that there is regulatory certainty for fintechs as to which regulator oversees which financing activity. The working group allows for the alignment of particularly the CMA and BNR in enabling innovative approaches to financing, e.g. by pooling respective sandbox resources. 
The wealthtech and insurtech working group
Wealthtech and insurtech. The global wealthtech solution market is expected to grow from RWF56.6 billion in 2021 to RWF142.5 billion by 2028, whereas the global insurtech market is expected to grow by $33.73 billion during 2021–2025. Both sub‑sectors have ample scope for growth in Rwanda, as they are currently the least developed fintech sectors (in terms of numbers) in Rwanda but offer great potential to better serve customers with options to manage their financial lives and deal with financial shocks while growing the depth of the financial sector.
Fintech can play a valuable role to help customers mitigate the impact of financial shocks and manage their financial planning and investments. In Rwanda, insurance penetration is low because mainstream products do not reflect the needs of the untapped consumer and MSME market. Insurtech can help to make products more customer-centric. An additional area for value-add is the potential to integrate insurtech with agricultural value chains to help individuals and businesses to proactively manage and mitigate climate-related risks. Likewise, the use of technology in wealth planning – wealthtech – has much potential.
This working group will focus on enabling wealthtech and insurtech applications in line with risks. Relevant working group topics include: the use of distributed ledger technologies for smart contracts in health and agriculture; artificial intelligence and machine learning; the use of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to enable proactive real-time risk management and mitigation; robotics and drone technology for disaster risk management; wealthtech applications for investment vehicles; cybersecurity; Open APIs; and the appropriate licensing regime for insurtech and wealthtech applications.
The regtech and suptech working group
Regtech and suptech. The rising threat of money laundering and other fraudulent activities is expected to propel the growth of the regtech and suptech globally. Subsequently, they are expected to have a significant impact not only on global markets. The global regtech market, for example, is expected to reach RWF19.6 trillion in 2025, whereas the suptech market is expected to grow by RWF33.7 billion during 2021–2025.
This focus area is specifically targeted at the use of technology to ease regulatory compliance among licensed financial service providers and to improve the reliability and timeliness of information received by regulators and policymakers to enhance supervisory efficacy and inform policy interventions. Regtech refers to the use of technology to facilitate financial institution reporting and compliance, and suptech refers to the use of technology in supervisory systems for risk and compliance monitoring. In Rwanda, both technology applications are increasingly relevant to help strengthen the inclusiveness and robustness of the financial sector, given ongoing updates in compliance requirements and supervisory approaches. A focus on regtech and suptech also supports risk-based supervision and a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism. 
Regtech and suptech also offer ample opportunity to strengthen financial integrity, to strengthen Rwanda’s reputation as an economic centre and to advance Rwanda’s dual policy goals. Suptech, for example, provides supervisory institutions with innovative technology to better supervise financial institutions. It also has the potential to support Rwanda’s digitalisation strategy by enabling supervisory agencies to digitise reporting and regulatory processes. Regtech on the other hand has the potential to improve Rwanda’s position as an innovation hub and financial centre. According to the World Government Summit (2018), there is a clear positive correlation between perception of regulatory quality and GDP per capita. The quality of regulation can also spur companies to innovate. Regtech thus offers Rwanda the opportunity to strengthen the perception of its regulatory quality, thereby improving its position as a financial centre and innovation hub.
Operationalising the working groups
    1. The working groups will be launched in a staggered approach, with the scope to add target sectors or focus areas as the need arises. The staggered approach allows for flexibility in ensuring that the working group structure remains fit for purpose. 
    2. The working groups will be constituted to include representatives from each key institution to take primary responsibility for actions most closely related to that institution’s objectives and key performance indicators. The working groups can also leverage and draw in ecosystem enablers such as RDB, KIC, FinTecHub and the fintech association as relevant. 
    3. Each working group will establish terms of reference and a workplan to guide their operations towards the achievement of the strategy in their respective focus area.
A central secretariat/implementation coordinator supports the operations of the steering committee and the working groups. It provides two kinds of support: administrative and technical support. In terms of administrative support, the secretariat/implementation coordinator facilitates, organises and provides capacity to the working groups. In so doing, it ensures transparency by effectively communicating and actively sharing information. It also monitors and reports on processes towards the achievement of the strategy objectives and provides the working group leads and co-leads with administrative and advisory support. In terms of technical support, the secretariat/implementation coordinator provides advice and inputs into key content areas for the steering committee and the working groups. This is to support the implementation of the strategy and to assist the steering committee in identifying future strategic objectives or focus sectors. For the fintech market, the set-up of the secretariat/implementation coordinator ensures a single point of contact that consolidates the various workstreams of the strategy.
Funding and required capacity. Funding these activities effectively will be key to the success of the strategy. The primary contribution from all the member organisations will be in-kind through participation of the steering committee and working groups. It is envisaged that senior capacity (department heads, DGs and association presidents) will form the steering committee, and it is estimated that the steering committee will be one to two days per quarter – allowing for preparation and attendance of the steering committee meetings. This will be greater during the end-of-year review of working groups and future workplans. 
The working groups should be staffed by relatively more junior capacity than the steering committee, and it is expected to require one to two days per month for preparation and attendance of the working group meetings and for coordination on activities, including updating the website. 
Additionally, specific activities, as identified in the implementation plan and to be further refined in the working group workplans, will require additional capacity. It is intended that for activities that can be conducted by one (or more) of the working group members (as it is in line with existing KPIs), this should be explicitly included in the annual workplans for submission to the steering committee and department heads to ensure that it is planned within members’ annual workplans. 
Finally, some activities will fall partially or entirely outside of the capability of working group members and will require external expertise. In this event, the lead institution for the activity should again consider whether this activity can be added to its own annual budget when the workplan is submitted. In cases where this is not possible, the working group should engage proactively with local donor organisations to articulate the terms of reference for the activity and request funding support to secure the required capacity.
The following sections list the detailed responsibilities of the steering committee, the secretariat/implementation coordinator and the working groups.
The steering committee 
The rationale for having a steering committee is to have a central governing structure that takes responsibility for overseeing the fintech strategy as it is adopted in 2022 and implemented until 2027. The steering committee is composed of 10 core institutions, six of which are public entities and four of which are private entities. The public entities – BNR, MINICT, MINECOFIN, RURA and the CMA – were selected based on their mandates to enable the fintech environment and/or interest and involvement in advancing the development of the fintech ecosystem in Rwanda. The private entities on the other hand – the RFL, RBA, ASSAR, AMIR and the fintech association – were selected based on their strategic significance for advancing the fintech strategy and for their strong existing roles in enabling fintech development. They also represent key private sector groups to ensure that the fintech strategy is a partnership between the public sector and the private sector. The main functions of the steering committee are: 
    1. To pool capacity and expertise to address the threats of insufficient capacity and competing projects. This also has the advantage of facilitating collaborating and creating collective knowledge, building a culture of learning, and adding new and diverse perspectives. 
    2. To ensure that the fintech strategy is a partnership between the public and private sector, thereby facilitating buy-in and a sense of shared responsibility for the implementation of the strategy. 
    3. To accommodate and leverage overlapping mandates for regulation, supervision, innovation and market development. 
    4. To leverage existing partnerships between steering committee members and external entities to action the proposed activities efficiently and effectively per working group. 
    5. To reduce risk and to increase strategy success by involving all relevant stakeholders and acknowledging differing views and opinions. This will solicit buy‑in from key public and private-sector players, will allow stakeholders to address challenges as they arise, and will create accountability for driving the fintech strategy. 
    6. To guide cross-cutting initiatives on topics falling outside of the parameters of a single working group. Such as researching and evaluating the need for a fintech talent pipeline which focusses on developing and creating uses for knowledge in technology, finance, and business and retaining that talent.  
The steering committee’s purpose and scope of activities are outlined in its terms of reference in Table 3 below: 

The steering committee’s terms of reference
Vision
The vision for the steering committee is to develop an enabling environment for fintechs, thereby establishing Rwanda as an innovation hub and promoting financial sector development.
Structure
Co-leads: MINICT and MINECOFIN
Participants: RFL, CMA, BNR, RURA, RBA, ASSAR, and Rwanda FinTech Association
Objectives
Oversee the working groups and synthesise cross-cutting areas for reform
Activities
    • Holding the working groups accountable
    • Providing overarching direction for the fintech strategy
    • Facilitating coordination across the working groups
    • Leading cross-cutting initiatives
    • Consider assembling an independent monitoring and evaluation group to audit the SC and WG progress on a at the middle of strategy implementation (2.5 years in) and at the end of strategy implementation (at the 5-year mark) 
Deliverables
    1. Owning a rolling, six-month activity list to keep track of what has been completed and what is to be completed 
    2. Annual reviews of the working groups
Table 3: The steering committee’s terms of reference
The steering committee is responsible for evaluating the success of the strategy. As mentioned, the steering committee will conduct annual reviews for each working group. In addition, the steering committee will conduct an evaluation of the strategy and its structures after two years (at the end of 2024). The purpose of this evaluation will be to integrate learnings and to improve structures to deliver on the five-year objectives. 
The proposed activities for the steering committee. The proposed activities are embedded in the dual policy objectives that underpin this fintech strategy. Thus, each proposed activity plays a fundamental role in setting Rwanda up as a testing ground for fintechs and establishing the country as a launchpad for fintech. The activities proposed for the steering group can be categorised into two groups:
    • The first group of activities relate to operations. These activities have been designed for, and assigned to, the steering committee with the purpose of outlining the scope of its practical day-to-day responsibilities. These activities relate to the administrative responsibilities such as holding fintech groups accountable and providing overarching direction for the fintech strategy to ensure that the vision be achieved.
    • The second group of activities relate to content. These activities are geared towards guiding the thematic focus of knowledge development under the fintech strategy for Rwanda. They entail considering the contextual relevance and potential risks and benefits of international trends for Rwanda. 
The secretariat/implementation coordinator 
The secretariat/implementation coordinator is the central support function. By nature, the secretariat/coordinator is a non-strategic entity. Its core purpose is to support operations for the steering committee and the working groups and to ensure transparency and accountability. It does so by facilitating discussions, by sharing resources, organising necessary events, forums and other platforms, and providing administrative capacity to the working groups. The secretariat/implementation coordinator should also provide technical and strategic inputs, advice and suggestions to the steering committee and the working groups on key content areas where possible for the consideration of the working groups and steering committee. The secretariat/implementation coordinator’s purpose and scope of activities of outlined in its terms of reference in Table 5 below:

The secretariat/implementation coordinator’s terms of reference
Vision

    • Scheduled monthly meetings per working group 
    • Monthly feedback to steering committee
    • Bi-annual report on fintech group progress
Table 4: The secretariat/implementation coordinator’s terms of reference
The working groups  
The rationale for the working groups is to have an implementation arm dedicated to executing the fintech strategy from 2022 to 2027. Each working group consists of a representative from the BNR, MINICT, RFL, CMA, MINECOFIN and RURA. Collectively this team leverages their existing expertise to: 
    • Ensure that the fintechs operating in their respective priority target areas have access to written and verbal guidance. 
    • Reduce, remove or ease the barriers to entry and operation.
    • Build expertise to ensure that it stays up to date with trends and developments. 
    • Introduce mechanisms that attract and enable fintechs to set up and operate in Rwanda and then expand operations into the region. 
Each working group is responsible for advancing the interests of a fintech sub-sector. Paytech, financing, wealthtech and insurtech, and regtech and suptech were strategically selected as the first four fintech subsectors due to their potential to a) drive local economic and social transformation and b) to facilitate the development of Rwanda’s goal to be a world-class innovation hub. 
A pilot approach will be adopted to roll out the working groups. To test the methodology of using working groups, their feasibility and design as well as to preserve resources, the working group roll-out will be staggered. Once the strategy is adopted, the first two working groups – on paytech and financing – will be launched. After six months, a review process will be conducted to evaluate the initial progress made. Based on the outcome of the review process, the second two working groups – on wealthtech and insurtech and regtech and suptech – will be launched. This approach has been reflected in the working-group-specific proposed activities which are further discussed below. 

The purpose and scope of activities of the working groups are outlined in its terms of reference in Table 6 below:
 
The working groups’ terms of reference
Vision
The vision is for each working group to collaborate on creating an enabling environment for fintech in which paytech, financing, wealthtech and insurtech, and regtech and suptech can thrive, respectively.

Responsibilities
    • Build expertise and credibility on technology in question.
    • Advise local regulators on the key risks within each sub-sector and global regulatory good practice. 
    • Advise on necessary regulatory or ecosystem reforms.
    • Promote Rwanda as a testing ground for fintechs. Particularly, within each priority sub-sector:
    • Identify and encourage potential fintech entrants; 
    • Assign a relevant working group member or entity to ensure that ecosystem facilitators are present, available and equipped to accompany fintechs through the regulatory, licensing and compliance journey, working with the relevant institutions along the way to ensure that the process is clear, smooth, quick and proactively communicated with the fintechs.
    • Coordinate with other fintech working groups such as the Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN).
    • Work in alignment with existing policies and strategies.
Deliverables (include but are not limited to)
    • Update website with sector-relevant materials
    • Work with the regulator to issue sector-specific position papers. 
    • Publish guidance papers and frequently asked questions (FAQs) in collaboration with the regulator.
    • Release governance frameworks to provide written guidance to fintechs on relevant topics. 
    • Provide verbal guidance via question and answer (Q&A) sessions.
    • Host public forums.
    • Organise and host fintech events around specific technologies or questions.
    • Enable regional representation by participating in regional working groups and, where possible, explore the feasibility of licensing portability.
    • Sign partnership agreements with key fintech hubs. 
Table 5: The working groups’ terms of reference
The proposed activities for working groups. The first set of proposed activities for the working groups is not specific to any working group. Each working group is required to establish itself and to conduct standardised working group activities. Table 7 below displays the proposed activities for all working groups.
Core activities
Working group establishment
1
Nominate a lead and co-lead.
2
Agree on frequency and modes of meeting.
3
Develop a working-group-specific workplan against working group objectives (delineating projects, programmes and activities) with an implementation strategy (containing descriptions, KPIs, goals, outputs, budget, assigned leading institutions per activity, and highlighted “quick wins”). 
4
Develop member roles based on job descriptions against working group objectives.
5
Develop and roll out public statement to notify the market of the working group.
6
Roll out a call for participation (inviting ecosystem facilitators to make themselves known to the working group, these participants will be drawn into key working group activities). This also acts as an informal channel to get market buy-in and support. Consider public–private dialogues to achieve this (biannual engagements). 
7
Provide quarterly progress updates to the steering committee. 
8
Agree on KPIs and areas for secretariat/implementation coordinator support.
9
Map fintech subsector ecosystem to understand who is providing, or can provide, support in each working group.
Ongoing working group activities
1
Update working-group-specific working plan annually. 
2
Provide quarterly progress updates to the steering committee. 
3
Monitor and evaluate (M&E) on a quarterly basis. 
Table 6: Proposed activities for working group establishment
The second set of proposed activities for the working groups is working-group specific. Based on the evaluation of global developments in fintech and on Rwanda’s fintech landscape, it is evident that regulatory clarity and certainty are the most important factor in creating an enabling environment. And this is most effectively done through soft guidance. Subsequently, many of the proposed activities are about providing fintechs with the necessary regulatory guidance for them to set up and operate in Rwanda and to expand out of Rwanda based on their sub-sector-specific needs. To support these activities, the working groups will also be responsible for actively encouraging fintechs in their respective sub-sectors through more assertive activities such as festivals, signalling the market, and for sector-specific research and support programmes with experts (likely with development partners) to support and inform growth of these fintechs. These activities have been categorised into three types: 
    • Written outputs. The first type of activity that the working groups are responsible for is written outputs. This entails the researching, development and publishing of key guidance material. Examples of this includes the production of position papers on existing and emerging topics and trends; guidance papers on areas relevant to the fintech sub-sector, such as the impact of the status of interoperability on payments; and updating the fintech-subsector-specific section of the website and newsletter. 
    • Process updates. The second type of activity involves removing barriers to fintech entry and operation, and improving key processes that fintechs regularly engage with. Thus, this type of working group activity is process updates. 
    • Verbal communications. The final type of working group activity is verbal communications. Here working groups will develop and leverage existing physical and digital platforms to promote Rwanda’s fintech sectors, to start dialogs on key themes, and to share and gain learnings and good practice.
The implementation roadmap document, to be read in succession of this strategy document, includes the proposed activities for all structures outlined in the strategy. This includes key activities for the steering committee, the secretariat, and for each working group. These activities will be considered and expanded upon by the participating institutions as each working group establishes themselves along the lines proposed in Table 7.
Annexure 1: Benchmarking exercise 
Fintech hub
Contributing factors to success
Singapore
Start-up-focused investor ecosystem
    • Sufficient access to capital to enable fintech growth across funding stages
    • Sufficient localised investors with networks and local market understanding
Progressive regulatory support
    • Support in place to encourage innovation
    • Support to establish networks and ecosystems to support hub establishment
    • Legal and regulated frameworks creating a level playing field for fintechs
Cross-border access to customers and partners
    • Number of customers accessible
    • Number of partners accessible and their attitudes to fintech collaboration
    • Cross-border alliances to support innovation and expansion
    • Proximity to neighbouring economies that are sufficiently well developed, with large populations where a substantial proportion uses digital financial services on a day-to-day basis
Business and tech talent pool
    • Access to sufficiently skilled tech and business talents within the market
    • Relative attractiveness of the fintech value proposition for these talents
Lithuania 
Took advantage of regional socio-economic trends.
Lithuania took advantage of Brexit, as the UK fell away as the gateway to the EU Lithuania stepped in. Its base and licences are now essential for operating in Europe. The kick-start that Brexit gave Lithuania’s success will make it difficult for other countries without this stimulus to replicate.
Solid infrastructure to attract fintechs. 
The Central Bank identified that it was hard for non-banks to gain access to the financial system without a partner, resulting in them setting up CENTROlink – Lithuania’s payment system which allows for customers of financial institutions to set up payments across SEPA (the EU’s payment-integration initiative). This was the biggest deterrent for fintechs coming into the country.
Lithuania provides easy access to licences and supports founders with admin. 
Lithuania allows companies to apply for licences remotely. The European Commission’s report on start-ups and scale-ups in Europe noted difficulties navigating regulations in other countries as one of their top roadblocks. To address this, the Bank of Lithuania guides them through this process.
Kenya
Financial education and financial inclusion
    • Extensive efforts were made in understanding the system and convincing consumers on M‑PESA to gain consumer trust
    • A financially included population, due to high mobile money usage, paved a way for growth of fintechs in other sub-sectors
Good infrastructure and people-centred innovation
    • High smartphone usage (44%) due to affordability and internet (85%) penetration in the EAC region
    • Equitel deployed agents, including in remote areas on the ground to demonstrate usage of financial product
Fintech support
Well-established tech support – with EAC’s tech support largely concentrated in Kenya
Innovative and proactive regulation
    • Possess a “test-and-learn” approach through the “letter of no objection” which was later formalised through the National Payment System Act to regulate payment systems and payment service providers, consequently promoting financial innovation
    • Regulators open to innovation and collaboration: multi-sector sandbox currently underway, which will address developments such as cryptocurrency and evolving payment technologies
Positive reputation and contextual advantages  
    • Leader in attracting investment in EAC – “approachable” entrepreneurs to investors 
    • High mobile-phone penetration and mass-demand-enabled rapid adoption of mobile money, which became a springboard for fintech
    • Well-established tech/expat community – with EAC’s tech support largely concentrated in Kenya
South Africa (SA) 
Firm and progressive regulatory support
    • Firm regulation in the financial services industry has been attributed as the main driver of growth for regtech adoption.
    • Regulators open and supporting digital innovation. The SA Government has various frameworks that provide funding and grants for start-ups while also providing tax incentives for investors (similar to the UK).
Support for fintech
    • SA has a sophisticated community supported by regular events, meet-ups and pitch evenings, which enable growth and innovation for fintechs and entrepreneurs.
    • Supports innovation in inflow of people to RSA – remote working visa (initial phase), which could potentially promote labour and skills transfer into the country
    • Sophisticated financial sector that creates conducive environment for attracting investments 
    • Substantial “local” sources of funding accessible for fintech start-ups
Inter-governmental collaboration 
    • Inter-governmental fintech working group launched
    • Financial regulators* to respond to financial sector changes as driven by fintechs while also driving innovation around regulation, consumer protection, and financial inclusion at all stages of growth.
Talent and skills pool
    • In addition to standard academic institutions, there is a presence of academic incubators to support the skills and talent base of potential start-ups, e.g. Blockchain Academy.
    • Start-ups possess both technical and commerce skills and other broad essential skills such as management, leadership, strategy and negotiation, etc.
Chile 
Presence in the Latin American region:
Building on Chile’s standing in the region as the leading economy to do business with, fintechs incubated in the country are increasingly leveraging this base to drive scale throughout the region. The internationalisation rate of Chilean fintech start-ups is 47%, which is significantly higher compared to the average for the region (32%)21.
Government support:
Chile’s strong growth to becoming one of the region’s primary fintech hubs has its roots in the country’s vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem. Government support has been key to this – launched in 2010, Start-Up Chile transformed entrepreneurship in its native country, accelerating more than 1,600 companies22.
Strong levels of financial inclusion
Relative to the rest of the Latin American region, Chile is characterised by high rates of bank account ownership, use of digital payments as well as mobile phone penetration – giving fintechs access to a population accustomed to digital financial services.

Table 8: Fintech Strategy Implementation Plan

Instrument/ Activity
Description and rationale
Guidance papers
Guidance papers are non-legally binding regulatory instruments. The primary objective of guidance papers are to provide regulatory guidance and clarity to fintechs (and other innovators in the market) on key topics. In some cases, these papers will therefore focus on explicitly interpreting the implication of existing regulation for fintechs within the market, e.g. explaining how the financial consumer protection regulations apply for specific fintech activities. This provides greater regulatory clarity to fintechs and fintech investors by interpreting laws and regulations that are not written specifically for fintech activity. Alternatively, guidance papers will consider emerging innovations or innovative developments, such as crypto assets, and articulate the regulator's understanding of the emerging innovation, the opportunities, the risks and how the regulator may consider formally regulating the innovation in future. In these cases, guidance papers provide a signal to the fintech market that the regulator understands the emerging innovation and allows the regulator to present their concerns and key risks to the market in a way that will influence fintechs activities (i.e. highlighting the key risks they need to address), but without immediately drafting regulation on topics that are not yet fully understood and that therefore may unintentionally impede further development on the innovation. Again, these guidance papers will provide regulatory clarity to fintechs operating within these innovative spaces, as well as allowing those fintechs to present back their learnings and inputs on the guidance position. In the Rwandan fintech market, a key finding, is that while the existing regulation is broadly enabling of fintech, there is an absence of proactive guidance, particularly on emerging innovation topics. 

Guidance papers should be developed both under the auspices of the Steering Committee for topics that cut across fintech sub-sectors, as well as under the auspices of the Working Groups for topics specific to individual sub-sectors. 

Guidance papers should be issued by regulatory authorities and hence, in all cases, a regulatory authority is the lead institution allocated to the development of the proposed guidance papers. Support and inputs should be provided from other supporting institutions.
Launch papers
Launch papers are communication tools to support the objectives of fintech strategy. Launch papers are primarily intended to signal to the local and global fintech communities Rwanda's thoughtful commitment to supporting fintech through specific and targeted support. Hence, it is proposed that each working group publishes a launch paper on the focus sub-sector when the working group kicks off. This aims to signal to market participants the focus that will be applied to the specific sub-sector, the activities that will be conducted under the auspices of the working group (this should be aligned to the activities articulated within the fintech strategy and workplan), and how participants can access the support provided through the working group.
Consultation papers
Consultation papers are communication tools to support the objectives of fintech strategy. Consultation papers are proposed under the Steering Committee and some working groups. These are intended as signalling and communication tools to highlight market opportunities, policy priorities and accompanying support to fintechs and the broader ecosystem – such as the importance of partnerships to drive fintech and the opportunities and demonstrated successes to reach underserved groups. These papers therefore serve to nudge and inform the fintech ecosystem and are termed consultation papers as they aim to open the discussion with industry on key topics.
Blog articles and write-ups
Blog articles and write-ups are communication tools to support the objectives of fintech strategy. Blog articles are far shorter and less formal than a consultation paper. They serve a similar purpose in nudging and guiding market players, but they are bite-sized and not comprehensive. A further key objective is to regularly publish blog articles and write-ups over the course of the strategy to ensure that constant communication is maintained and consistent focus on fintech in Rwanda is perceived to be maintained throughout the strategy implementation, particularly in between the publication of guidance and position papers. The topics for these blogs and articles should frequently, although not exclusively, relate to the topics already published through guidance and position papers and/or to the ongoing activities of the fintech strategy implementation.
Regional regulator convening
Hosting of regional regulator convenings serves the purpose of developing a better understanding of fintech activities taking place throughout the region, but also to coordinate and harmonise various fintech regulatory aspects in order to improve the business case for fintechs to entering the region. Hosting regulatory convenings can help to position Rwanda's regulators as regional leaders. A key objective of this mentioned throughout the strategy is facilitating licensing portability, which would ease the ability of fintechs to expand and gain scale within the East African or Central African regions. 
Regional forum
Regional forums provide a platform to share learnings and good practices stemming from new and established fintechs that operate in Rwanda. The presence of regional fintech players also offers a space for ensuring an open dialogue between Rwandan regulators and industry participants that may not have entered the Rwandan market, and for sharing demonstration cases of success. Here, potential fintechs that offer products and services that might complement the Rwandan market can be approached and enticed into piloting in Rwanda. Regional forums also offer an opportunity for supporting the development of external connections to other geographic clusters and fintech hubs with the ultimate aim of securing MOUs where such a relationship is mutually beneficial. 
Annual global forum
Annual global forums offer many of the same benefits as regional forums, except at a global level. The hosting of global forums also provides a key signal to the global fintech industry that Rwanda is a big player in the space and open to fintechs from all six continents.
Q&A sessions
Q&A sessions are another communication tool to elaborate on the guidance papers published by the respective working groups. These offer an opportunity for industry players to clarify and request additional information on the varying aspects included in the guidance papers. While the Q&A session does not systematically add information beyond that given in the guidance paper, a clarification role is key to ensuring the market and the regulator are on the same page and have a clear understanding. A well-conducted and clear Q&A session also provides comfort to the market and signals to potential fintechs that the regulatory environment is characterised by stability and a regulator that is open to innovation.
