        <h1>Writing Portfolio</h1>
        <p>
          I started writing professionally in 2018, and have written across a
          variety of industries and topics.I like nothing better than working
          with clients over a range of projects. I get to know them, their
          voice, and their business goals inside outâ€”and together we can work on
          a strategy that covers their whole customer experience.
